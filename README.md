# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This repository showcases my SQL skills in analyzing COVID-19 data. The project involves querying data from "CovidDeaths" and "CovidVaccinations" tables.

## Highlights

- Extracted insights like total cases vs total deaths and total cases vs population for Canada.
- Identified countries with the highest infection rate compared to population.
- Analyzed countries with the highest death count and continents with the highest death count per population.
- Computed global COVID-19 statistics, including total cases, deaths, and death percentage.
- Implemented a rolling vaccination count using SQL window functions.
- Created a temporary table and a view for better data organization.

## Technologies Used

- SQL
- Window functions for data analysis
- Temporary table for intermediate results
- View for simplifying complex queries

## Usage

The SQL queries in this project can be executed using any SQL database management tool.

## Note

The queries themselves are available in the SQL files within the repository for more detailed examination.

Feel free to reach out for further discussion or clarification.
